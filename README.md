# Trello Background Override

Trello does not support personal board backgrounds and forces everyone to use the same image/color/gradient. This little extension removes image backgrounds and forces a color background on all Trello boards. Set the color in inject.css.

## Usage

- Download and Extract
- Go to the Extension Management and enable Developer Mode
- Select "Load Unpacked Extension" and navigate to the extracted directory
- Optional: Set the background color in "inject.css"
- Optional: Restart Chrome
